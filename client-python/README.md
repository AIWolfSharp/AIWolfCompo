# AIWolf Python Client HOWTO

## Python Library for the AIWolf server:

Kei Harada has created [aiwolfpy](https://github.com/aiwolf/AIWolfPy), a python
module that facilitates communication between a python client and the JAVA
server.

## English documentation for aiwolfpy:

Eduardo Hauck has created [a sample client](https://github.com/ehauckdo/AIWoof)
using aiwolfpy, along with [a programming guide](https://github.com/ehauckdo/AIWoof/blob/master/manual/AgentProgramming.md).

## Sample agent:

The 'omgyousuck' folder contains the code for a simple python werewolf agent.
This agent will vote and accuse the last player to vote or accuse it.
Please feel free to use this code as a base for your own agents.
