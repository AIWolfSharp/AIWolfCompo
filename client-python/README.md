# AIWolf Python Client HOWTO

Kei Harada has created [aiwolfpy](https://github.com/aiwolf/AIWolfPy) a python
module that facilitates communication between a python client and the JAVA
server.

Eduardo Hauck has created [a sample client](https://github.com/ehauckdo/AIWoof)
using aiwolfpy, along with [a collection of programming
notes](https://github.com/ehauckdo/AIWoof/blob/master/manual/AgentProgramming.md). The code of the sample agent 'omgyousuck' is copied in this repository. This
agent will vote and accuse the latest player that voted or accused it.
