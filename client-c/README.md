# AIWolf C# programming Howto

Professor Takashi Otsuki has [created a presentation](https://www.slideshare.net/takots/how-to-make-an-artificial-intelligence-based-werewolf-agent-in-c-using-visual-studio)
for creating AIWolf clients in C#. These slides are a for an older version of
the AIWolf server, but should  be able to give an idea of how to program the
agent for the newer version  as well (AIWolf servers should be mostly backwards
compatible)
