# Help Wanted

This is the first year where the AIWolf competition is being held in English at
an international venue. While the AIWolf project has extensive documentation in Japanese, the amount of documentation available in English is still limited.

## You can help!

We count on the help of the community to contribute materials in English and
increase the international reach of the AIWolf project. Contributions on the
following topics are specially appreciated:

- Sample code (Specially C#, but more sample code in Java and Python is appreciated)
- Tutorials (sample agents or specific techniques)
- Discussion of techniques

If translating Japanese material, make sure that you have permission from the
original author.
